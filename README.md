### **The Redeemed Constant: Vacuum Self-Tuning and the Unification of Dark Energy in the CTG**

*By Manuel Martín Morales Plaza*

This paper presents the final resolution to the **Cosmological Constant Problem (PCC)**, the most severe conflict in fundamental physics, which involves a discrepancy of $\mathbf{10^{120}}$ orders of magnitude.

The **Constitutive Theory of Gravity (CTG)** is formally completed, establishing itself as the first theory capable of resolving the three fundamental crises: the PCC, the $\mathbf{\sigma_8}$/JWST cosmological tensions, and the Dark Matter paradigm.

### Key Findings and Dynamical Validation

The resolution is achieved via the **Constitutive Polarity Field ($\mathbf{\Psi}$/CPFA)**, which introduces a dynamic *Self-Tuning* mechanism.

1.  **$\mathbf{10^{120}}$ Order Cancellation:** We derive the CTG Consistency Relation, $\mathbf{\Lambda_{\text{obs}} = \Lambda_{\text{quantum}} - V(\Psi)_{\text{min}}}$. The potential minimum $V(\Psi)_{\text{min}}$ is dynamically forced to cancel the massive quantum vacuum energy $\mathbf{\Lambda_{\text{quantum}}}$.
2.  **Universal Attractor:** Numerical validation of the $\mathbf{\Psi}$ Equation of Motion (EOM) ($\mathbf{\ddot{\Psi} + 3H(t)\dot{\Psi} + dV/d\Psi = 0}$) confirms that the self-tuning mechanism is a **universal attractor**. The field converges robustly to $\mathbf{\Psi_{\min}}$ regardless of initial conditions, eliminating the need for *fine-tuning*.
3.  **Dynamic Dark Energy Residue:** The observed Dark Energy is not a static constant. It is the inevitable **dynamic residue** ($\mathbf{\Lambda_{\text{obs}} \sim H_0^2 M_P^2}$) that emerges when the Hubble friction term ($\mathbf{3H(t)\dot{\Psi}}$) weakens in the late-time universe ($\mathbf{H \to H_0}$). This simultaneously resolves the **Cosmic Coincidence Problem**.

### Implication

The **CTG** establishes a foundation where the $\mathbf{\Psi}$ field mediates vacuum energy, securing a coherent, quantitative, and elegant solution to the greatest problem in theoretical physics.

**Priority:** This work is of critical, transformative importance and must be submitted to the highest-impact venue (e.g., *Nature* or *Science*).
